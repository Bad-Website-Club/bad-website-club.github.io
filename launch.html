          <h3>Jo Francetti: Are You a Perfectionist?</h3>
          <p>We've all heard it before, when someone answers the interview question "What is your greatest weakness?" with "I'm a perfectionist". Because perfectionists are supposed to be brilliant achievers who care about the quality of their work and what people think of their work. But what if perfectionism is really a blocker to achievement? After all, achieving perfection is not something that happens often. We'll talk about how perfectionism can affect your work, mental health and life in general, how to spot it in yourself and others, and how to speak back to it when you need to.</p>
