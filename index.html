        <h1>Bad Website Club!</h1>
        <p>Learning programming skills can be lonely, and it often feels like there's so much you need to know to call yourself a programmer. </p> 
            
            <p>Ram√≥n and Jess have taught over 35,000 <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/">learners via our fre</a>e programming bootcamps* and are really excited to be launcing a new social learning project where we'll learn just enough web skills to be dangerous alongside all of you. </p>
            
            <p>*Don't worry, we'll keep doing bootcamps too! Watch Class Central's blog to see when we'll launch new ones.</p>
