        <h1>Bad Website Club!</h1>
        <p>Learning programming skills can be lonely, and it often feels like there's so much you need to know to call yourself a programmer. </p>

            <p>Ram√≥n and Jess have taught over 35,000 learners via our free programming bootcamps* and are really excited to be launching a new social learning project where we'll learn just enough web skills to be dangerous alongside all of you. </p>

            <p>*Don't worry, we'll keep doing bootcamps too! Watch this space.</p>

                <summary>How much will this cost?</summary>
                It's free, we like teaching and hate handling cash
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Really free? How can it be free?</summary>
                    Really free. We donate our time because teaching is cool. There's no way to pay us.
                    </details>

                                    <details>
                    <summary>Will you help me find a job in tech?</summary>
                    I'm so sorry that due to the size global distribution of our learners on past projects, we've found that we can't offer effective and targeted employment support. We'll help you learn the skills, it's up to you to decide how and where to apply them.

                                    <details>
                    <summary>What if the scheduled times don't work for me?</summary>
                    We're really sorry about that! All streams and videos will be available on demand and we'll have asynch learner support channels on launch.

                    <summary>This website sucks?</summary>
                    Ok, that's not really a question, but we're going to make it suck less, together, as we learn.
